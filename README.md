At first: Remember to write npm install in the client
-> `cd client`
-> `npm install`
-> `npm run dev`


Then you also need to install npm in server so next put to your console:
-> `cd ..`
-> `cd server`
-> `npm install`
-> `npm run dev`

When your home work station is set up, ALWAYS remember to run "git pull" before starting to work in order to get the newest version of the repository. 

After done working and having functional code that doesn't break the code for others remember to:
- git add .
- git commit -m "*short description of changes*"
- git push -u origin main
